## About the Website
I'm a student majoring in Mathematics and Philosophy, so web-developing or coding are not something I'm really familiar with. However, I'm really proud that I try make this possible with next.js and tailwind.css. This project can't be possible without the help of KK(https://github.com/kkuroma) and Win(https://github.com/pongsaphol). This website will be worked more and more. Hope you like the website
